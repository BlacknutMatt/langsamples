Just like movies, books, photographs, and any other form of visual art, games are experiences meant to be enjoyed by every human. Unfortunately, many people don't have easy access to gaming. And for those that already do have access, game discovery is costly and time consuming. Across the globe, 500 games launch daily, how do you know which ones to play? We're here to make games accessible and optimize the game discovery experience by featuring the best games, from AAAs to hidden indie games. Try them all out, and never miss out on a game again.",

First is to provide a catalog of games that brings a richness and abundance that doesn’t exist today. Our platform has a myriad of games that range in theme, style, and approach and allow users to have new experiences in gaming that they otherwise would not have. Second is our focus on ease of access and use - games on our platform are available across smart devices and can be started on one device and finished on another. Last is our dedication to curation which is to say seeking and selecting the best games for the platform. Curation lets our users discover the best games and brings to light important creations made by both indie studios and AAA publishers.</p>",
